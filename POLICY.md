# **Privacy Policy for ABotmo**

_Last Updated: [27/03/2025]_

## **1. Introduction**
We warmly welcome **ABotmo**. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information while you interact with our open-source Discord bot. By using **ABotmo**, you agree to the terms outlined in the following sections.

## **2. Data Acquisition**
**ABotmo** does not gather, store, or share any personal data except for what is necessary for its operational processes. However, in the course of its operation, the bot might temporarily process the following data:

- **User Identifiers** (used for command execution, authorization, or logging features)
- **Server and Channel Identifiers** (used for maintaining bot configurations or running automated tasks)
- **Communications** (only provided when needed for bot commands, and never stored long-term)

### **Third-Party APIs**
If the bot interacts with external services, such as OpenAI, YouTube, or other APIs, the privacy policies of the respective entities will apply.

## **3. Data Usage**
Data collected is used solely for:
- Compliance with instructions
- Maintaining bot functionality (e.g., role management, moderation, logging)
- Enhancing user experience (e.g., saving user preferences)

We do not sell, distribute, or use this information for marketing purposes.

## **4. Protecting and Preserving Data**
- **ABotmo** does not store user interactions, personal information, or any sensitive data permanently.
Transitory data, such as command responses or configuration data, can be stored only for the time required to enable the functionality of the bot.
If your server has the ability to log operations, recorded data will remain until an administrator chooses to remove it.

## **5. Information Dissemination and Protective Measures**
- **User information is not shared** with outside parties unless required by law. - This bot is not open-source, after 100 guild installs the source-code will then be provided.

- Although we take reasonable precautions to ensure security, users should understand that Discord bots operate within the confines of Discord’s infrastructure.

## **6. Rights and Authority of Users**

- You can request the removal of your data by contacting the bot owner (@veraveemo)

- Server administrators have the ability to kill the bot at any time, thus stopping all data processing related to that specific server.

## **7. Amendments to This Policy**

This policy is revised from time to time. Users will be notified of significant changes via the bot's **GitHub repository** or an announcement on the **Discord server**.

## **8. Contact Information** If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please do not hesitate to contact us:
