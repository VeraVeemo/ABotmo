## Features

The bot includes:
- 8 moderation commands
- 8 miscellanous commands
- 6 fun commands
- Saving user roles and reapplying to them on rejoin
- Databases
- Moderation logging
- Bot Status detection
- Channel-topic updating
- Logging all commands in console
- Filtering words and spam
- Permission checking
- & more, soon...

## Key Info

The bot's commands are not suited for other guilds, so as of now (27/03/2025 DD/MM) moderation commands and other(s) are disabled. I do not see any one using the bot in their server so unless someone wants to I will then make a database for more servers and enable all commands.

You will not get all commands for ABotmo in DMs as I have not been verified, and in the Server you will need to install it into your account to see the rest of the commands. However for the server command issue, it'll be removed after the above issue is resolved.

## Goals

üî∑ /invite
- A simple invite command that gives the discord server invite and bot installs.

üî∑ /define
- A lightweight command that defines the word you input and outputs the definition back to you with optional privacy

üî∑ /8ball
- Magic 8ball, the thing we all know that is keen to answering questions (with RNG)! Answer your question away and get 1 of 15 responses!

üî∑ /coinflip
- Lightweight command that is very short in code, 1 in 2 chance to get heads or tails.

üî∑ /roll
- Roll a virtual dice/die! This is a bit hard to understand so come back to here if you need help.

~ The first number stand for how many rolls, the d is required so you then can input how many sides you want!
- Example:
"2d6" = Rolls two 6 sided die.

üî∑ /agecheck (REQUESTED BY SHELL LURKER)
- Depending on user info (excluding commands), the bot will essentially "add age" depending on user info to the output age and then give you it once it's done.
